name_of_project_still_in_process - an exchange platform for everyone, also in the form of online-auction, who wants to read some books, except you don't buy it directly from shops, but share it with other book holders, you can share your book, sell your book and make an auction for other buyers. At first we create a web-site, where every user can have their own account page and they can add their own books to a library storage. In this library page we have a list of all the books that people want to share, which sorted by genres, popularuty, styles and other parametrs. By online-auction we mean that some books can appear rare, costly and to be in high demand, so we let our client-partners to adjust prices with auction feature.
